All the scripted code should work on a clean Python 3 install (I'm using 3.10.6).

I will include future dependencies in `dependencies.txt`

The runnable script is in `main.py`, which can be run from the command line with `python3 main.py`. 

Other scripts that are useful are in the `parsing` and `analyzers` folders.
